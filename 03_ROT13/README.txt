🔐 Challenge 03: ROT13
----------------------

An intercepted note was found in the logs of a compromised account. It’s readable... sort of. But every letter looks just a bit off — like someone twisted the alphabet around.

This challenge introduces **ROT13**, a simple cipher that shifts each letter by 13 places. It was once used to obscure messages without really encrypting them — but it’s still great for hiding things from casual observers.

Your task: decode the scrambled message and find the hidden flag.

What to do:
1. Double-click the `decode_rot13.sh` script in this folder.
2. When prompted, choose **“Run in Terminal”**.
3. Let the script guide you through decoding the message.

No need to type any commands — everything runs for you.

📄 The message is stored in: `cipher.txt`

🏁 Flag format: CCRI-XXX-###
