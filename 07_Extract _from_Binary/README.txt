🔍 Extract from Binary
======================

A mysterious binary has appeared on your desktop: `hidden_flag`.

Your objective is to analyze the file using forensic techniques and extract the correct flag. Only ONE of the flags follows the CCRI challenge format and is valid.

🛠️ Tools You'll Use:
- `strings`: Extracts readable text from binary files.

💡 What to Do:
1. Run the interactive script (`analyze_binary.sh`) to help you extract strings from the binary.
2. Inspect the output. Look for strings that match this format: `CCRI-AAAA-1111`.
3. One of them is the real flag. Use your best judgment to pick the correct one.

📦 Files Included:
- `hidden_flag` → the compiled binary with hidden data
- `analyze_binary.sh` → a guided script to walk you through it

Good luck, forensic specialist!
