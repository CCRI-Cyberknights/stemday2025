🧠 Challenge #10 – Metadata

Someone left behind a suspicious image — and we think it hides more than it shows.

Your mission is to inspect the file's metadata and discover the correct flag.

⚠️ Be careful — the image contains 4 fake flags and only 1 real one.
Look for one that is clearly confirmed or valid.
