🧩 Challenge 02: Base64
-----------------------

You’ve intercepted a suspicious message from a compromised machine. The file `encoded.txt` contains a block of seemingly meaningless text — but the pattern looks familiar. You’ve seen something like this before when data is passed through systems that expect only plain text.

This challenge introduces **Base64**, a common encoding format that turns binary data into readable characters. It’s not encryption — anyone who knows how can reverse it. But it’s perfect for hiding small things in plain sight.

Your goal is to decode the message, identify what it's hiding, and recover the flag.

What to do:
1. Double-click the `solve.sh` script in this folder.
2. When prompted, choose **“Run in Terminal”**.
3. Follow the prompts to decode the message.

No command-line experience is needed — the script will walk you through it!
