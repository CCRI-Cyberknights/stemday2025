🧩 Challenge 04: Vigenère Cipher

You’ve recovered a scrambled message from an intercepted communication. Analysts believe it’s been encoded using the Vigenère cipher — a letter-based cipher that scrambles messages using a repeating keyword.

🧠 Your task: Decrypt the message and recover the real agency flag.

🔐 Hint:
What’s the opposite of logout?

💡 Answer that riddle and try using that word to decode the file.

📄 Encrypted file: cipher.txt  
🖥️ Script to run: break_vigenere.sh

🚫 Not every decoded result will be valid.
Only one flag matches the official format: CCRI-AAAA-1111

Good luck, Agent. 🕵️
