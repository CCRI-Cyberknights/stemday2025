ðŸ§  Challenge #09 â€“ Fix the Flag! (Bash Edition)
-----------------------------------------------

A Bash script is supposed to print the full agency flag... but it's broken!

Right now it only prints a two-digit number at the end.

Run the launcher script and follow the instructions.
It will show you the broken code and ask you to fix it.

ðŸš© Flag format: CCRI-AAAA-1111
