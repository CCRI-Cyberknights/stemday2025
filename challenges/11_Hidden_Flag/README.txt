ðŸ§  Challenge #11 â€“ Find the File

Somewhere in this folder structure lies a hidden file containing the next flag.

But beware â€” not all flags are real. Four fakes were planted to confuse intruders.

ðŸŽ¯ Your mission:
Use the helper script or your own command-line skills to uncover hidden files and locate the **one real flag**.

Only one follows the official format:
  CCRI-AAAA-1111
  
ðŸš« The rest may look similar but use the wrong prefix or order:
  FLAG-HIDE-####
  HIDE-####-CODE
  etc.

ðŸ›  Try using commands like:
  find, ls -a, cat

ðŸ“‚ Start with the helper:
  ./search_for_flag.sh
