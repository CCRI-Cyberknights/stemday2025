Your task is to:
  1. Use the provided script to view and scan each QR code.
  2. Observe the code that is revealed from each image.
  3. Determine which one looks like a valid flag.
  4. Submit the correct one to the scoreboard.

ðŸ›  How to begin:

  â€¢ Double-click the script: explore_qr.sh
    (or right-click â†’ Run in Terminal)

  â€¢ It will let you view each image for 20 seconds.
    Use your phone to scan if you want!

  â€¢ After viewing, the script will decode the image
    and save the result to qr_results.txt

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Only one decoded result matches the format CCRI-AAAA-1111.
