ðŸ§  Challenge #16 â€“ Hex Flag Hunter
-------------------------------------

ðŸ’¼ Situation:
Weâ€™ve intercepted a suspicious binary file named `hex_flag.bin` from a hackerâ€™s stash. Itâ€™s too small to be a real program, but we suspect it contains a **hidden flag** embedded somewhere in the data.

ðŸŽ¯ Your Mission:
Use your forensic skills to scan the binary and locate the correct flag.

ðŸ“– HINTS:
- The flag is **hidden as ASCII text** inside the binary. It follows this format:
  `CCRI-AAAA-1111`
- There are **five candidate flags** scattered throughout the file, but only ONE is correct.
- Some hex editors can display both hex and ASCII at the same time.

ðŸ›  Tools at Your Disposal:
- **hexedit** â†’ Interactive hex editor (easiest for scrolling/searching).
- **xxd** â†’ Dumps the file as hex + ASCII.
- **strings** â†’ Might help, but not all candidates will show up cleanly.

---

ðŸ“‚ Files Provided:
- `hex_flag.bin` â€“ Suspicious binary to investigate.
- `inspect_binary.sh` â€“ Helper script to launch hex editors.

âœ… Once you find the correct flag, paste it into the **flag verifier** in the student hub to confirm your success.
